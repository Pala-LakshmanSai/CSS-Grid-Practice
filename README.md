# CSS-Grid-Practice
This repository consists of CSS grid layouts, which helped me figure out where I was and master the CSS grid concept with ease.
Here are the demos of those layouts:
1. layout 1
  ![Grid1](grid1/grid1.png)
1. layout 2
  ![Grid2](grid2/grid2.png)
1. layout 3
  ![Grid3](grid3/grid3.png)
1. layout 4
  ![Grid4](grid4/grid4.png)
